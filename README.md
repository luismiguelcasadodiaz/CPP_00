The goal of these modules is to introduce you to Object-Oriented Programming.

This will be the starting point of your C++ journey. Many languages are recommended to learn OOP. We chose C++ since itâ€™s derived from your old friend C.

Because this is a complex language, and to keep things simple, your code will comply with the C++98 standard.

You will discover new concepts step-by-step. The exercises will progressively increase in complexity.

## C++ 98 Standard

Below are the key features and improvements brought by C++ 98:


|Feature|	Description|	Syntax|
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
|**Templates**|	C++ 98 standardized the use of templates, allowing the <ins>creation of generic functions and classes</ins>. This made it possible to write code that works with any data type.|	```template <typename T> T add(T a, T b) { return a + b; }```|
|**Exceptions**	|Exception handling was standardized in C++ 98, providing a <ins>structured way to handle errors</ins> and exceptional conditions in programs.	|```try { // code } catch (exception& e) { // handle error }```|
|**Namespaces**|	C++ 98 introduced namespaces to <ins>avoid name conflicts by grouping entities</ins> like classes, objects, and functions under a specific name.|	```namespace MyNamespace { int value; }```|
|The **bool Type**|	C++ 98 introduced the bool data type, along with the <ins>true and false</ins> keywords, for representing boolean values.|	```bool flag = true;```|
|The **typename** Keyword|	The typename keyword was introduced to <ins>disambiguate dependent names</ins> in templates, improving readability and reducing errors.|```typename T::iterator it;```|
|The **explicit** Keyword|	C++ 98 introduced the explicit keyword to <ins>prevent implicit type conversions</ins>, which can lead to subtle bugs.	|```explicit MyClass(int value);```|
|Member Function **const**ness|	C++ 98 allowed member functions to be declared as const, <ins>ensuring that they do not modify the object on which they are called</ins>.|```	int getValue() const { return value; }```|
|**Member Templates**|C++ 98 introduced the ability to <ins>define templates within class definitions</ins>, allowing for more flexible and reusable code.|```template <typename T> class MyClass { /*...*/ };```|
|**Template Specialization**|Allows the creation of template specializations for specific types, enabling <ins>more efficient or specialized implementations</ins>.|```template<> class MyClass<int> { /*...*/ };```|
|**Multiple Inheritance and Virtual Functions**|C++ 98 standardized the behavior of multiple inheritance and virtual functions, ensuring <ins>consistency across compilers</ins>.|```class Derived : public Base1, public Base2 { };```|
|The **mutable** Keyword|Allows modification of class members even if the containing object is const, providing <ins>more flexibility in certain designs</ins>.|```mutable int counter;```|
|**Dynamic Memory Management**|C++ 98 standardized the new and delete operators to <ins>handle heap memory allocation and deallocation consistently</ins>.|```c int* p = new int(5); delete p; ```|

## Namespaces

Scope resolution operator `::`



```cpp
#include <stdio.h>

int	gl_var = 1;
int	f( void ) { return (2); }

namespace	Foo
{
	int	gl_var = 3;
	int	f( void ) { return (4); }
}

namespace	Bar
{
	int	gl_var = 5;
	int	f( void ) { return (6); }
}

namespace Muf = Bar;

int	main ( void )
{
	printf( "gl_var:     [%d]\n", gl_var );
	printf( "f():        [%d]\n\n", f() );

	printf( "gl_var:     [%d]\n", Foo::gl_var );
	printf( "f():        [%d]\n\n", Foo::f() );

	printf( "gl_var:     [%d]\n", Bar::gl_var );
	printf( "f():        [%d]\n\n", Bar::f() );

	printf( "gl_var:     [%d]\n", Muf::gl_var );
	printf( "f():        [%d]\n\n", Muf::f() );

	printf( "gl_var:     [%d]\n", ::gl_var );
	printf( "f():        [%d]\n\n", ::f() );

	return (0);
}
```

``` bash
gl_var:     [1]
f():        [2]

gl_var:     [3]
f():        [4]

gl_var:     [5]
f():        [6]

gl_var:     [5]
f():        [6]

gl_var:     [1]
f():        [2]
```

## Iostreams

Two magical objects `cin` and 'cout'
Two new operators `<<` (back arrows or ) and `>>` (forward arrows or greater than greater than)

```cpp
#include <iostream>
 std::endl
 ```

 `endl` is an object from standard library that represents the `carriage return` for the operating system.

 [c++ iosstream reference](https://cplusplus.com/reference/iostream/)
 
 ## Classes and instances

Do not forget `;` at class's end declaration.

Class Name is used as Contructor for the class.

Member attribute is a variable in the class declared in the public part
Member functions is a function the class can use. I declare it with the namespace

## Instance constructor with **initialitation list**

```cpp
Sample1::Sample1( char p1, int p2, float p3 ): a1(p1), a2(p2), a3(p3)
{
    std::cout << "Constructor Sample1 called" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "this->a1 = " << this->a1 << std::endl;
    std::cout << "this->a2 = " << this->a2 << std::endl;
    std::cout << "this->a3 = " << this->a3 << std::endl;
    this->bar();
    return ;

}
```

## Const

The keyword `const` declares a variable as a constant.

A constant can not be assigned any value to, except at initialization time.

The more constants we use in our code the safer code we will produce.

Inside a class, when a member attribute is declared const, the value to such const will be defined at instantiation time, at run-time, not at compile-time.

Attention to the language describing what happens during initialization list. 

In `a1(p1)` we do not **assign** the value `p1` to the attribute `a1`, but we **initialize** the attribute `a1` with the value `p1`
### const function or read-only classes.
We must, as a good practice, add the keyword `const` after the declaration and the definition of a member function that does not modifiy any member attribute. The compiler will save us from involuntary modifications of of attributes inside member functions that do not have to modify nothing.

THat good practice will help us to generate more robust code.

## Visibility (public, private)

Controls class's encapsulation.
Define which member attributes and member functions are accessible from inside or outside 

private, only accesible form class inside.
public, accesible from class inside and outside

constructor and destructor go in the public side.

Prefix with underscore private members.

The compiler will report any tentative of access from class outside to private members.

It is crucial a good definition of what is visible and what is hidded to the classe user.

## Class vs struct

struct's syntax is a mimetic  class's syntax

In C++ by default the struct' scope is public and the class' scope is private

## Accessors

For private attribute we create small proxy funcions to access them.

We name this small proxy funcion using prefixes "get" and "set"

The get proxies must be "Const".

The set proxies take care of private class invariants.

## Comparisons

Comparisons on structures. Compares only structures addresses. if structures have same values, a regular comparison with == gives a wrong answer.

Let's say == test if both structures are phisically in same memory space.
We need a member function that test individually if any structure field differ from the
corresponding field form other strucuture. 

## Non member attributes and functions

Non member attributes/functions means class attributes/functions.

The member exists dans un instance. it is different for each instance.

`static` has a new meaning in Cpp. we use it to declare nom member attributes/functions

Instead of `this->` we use the class name to access non member attributes/functions.

Non member attributes initialization takes place inside the class.cpp file

## Pointers to members

```c++

#include <iostream>

class Sample
{
	public:
	int 	foo;
	Sample(void) { }
	~Sample(void) { }
	void bar(void) const { std::cout << "BAR" << std::endl;}

};

int	main(void)
{
	Sample	instance;
	Sample	*instancePtr = &instance;

	// syntax pointer on class attribute of type int
	int		Sample::*p = NULL; 
	// but Which one?
	p = &Sample::foo;
	// but from which instance? we use operator "point-star"(.*)
	instance.*p = 21;
	// or the operator "arrow-star"(->*)
	instancePtr->*p = 21;

	// syntax pointer on class method of type void
	// transpirs c suntax for pointer to functions
	void	(Sample::*f)( void ) const;
	// but to which method?
	f = &Sample::bar;
	// but from which instance? we use operator "point-star"(.*)
	(instance.*f)();
	// or the operator "arrow-star"(->*)
	(instancePtr->*f)();

	return (0);
}
```

# Cpp piscine Day 01
## New et delete
Neither Malloc nor free form c call the class's constructor/destructor. THis is why new and delete exist in c++;

new() calls first to malloc() then calls the class constructor and returns a pointer to the new created object.

delete() first calls the class destructor then free().

```c++
 Student *jim = new Student("jim");
 delete jim;
```
### Creation of an array of object

 New() wiht an array does not accept any argument, so a constructor wihtout parametre must exist in the class.

 ```c++
 Students *students = new Student[42];
 delete [] students;
```
Pay attention to the empty pair of square bracktes before the array of object to destroy.

## References

A reference is a pointer with this characteristiques:


+ It is constant.
+ It is alway dereferenced.
+ it is never null.

  It works like an alias to a variable

  ```c++
  int	num = 42;
  int *numptr = &num;
  inr &numref = num
  int &numref2; //invalid. you can not create a reference pointign to null.
  ```

A reference always point towards something. It is never null. But if what was pointed towards has been released, the reference had not the right to access to it.

numref is used as it is. no need por asterisk or ampersand.

### Passing parameters by reference

std::string text = "Luis"

| type |        Parameter definition        |   funcion call  |
|------|------------------------------------|-----------------|
|by ptr|byPtr(std::string *name)            |byPtr(&text)     |
|by ptr|byConstPtrf(std::string const *name)|byConstPtr(&text)|
|by ref|byRef(std::string &name)            |byRef(text)      |
|by ref|byConstRef(std::string const &name) |byCosntRef(text) |

### Argument passage inside the funciton 's call.

private:
std::string _login;

| type |        Function's signature        |    return sentence    |
|------|------------------------------------|-----------------------|
|by ref|std::string       &getLoginRef()    |return this->_login;   |
|by ref|std::string const &getLoginCnstRef()|return this->_login;   |
|by ptr|std::string       *getLoginPtr()    |return &(this->_login);|
|by ptr|std::string const getLoginCosntPtr()|return &(this->_login);|

### Get a leftValue to assign somethind

```c++
obj.getLoginRef() = "newLogin";

*(obj.getLoginPtr()) = "newLogin";
```

## Filestreams

Input file std::ifstream
Output file std::ifstream

```c++

#incude <iostream>
#include <fstream>

int main(void)
{
 // input filestream 
 std::ifstream ifs("numbers");//ouverture du fichier numbers
 unsigned int dst;
 unsigned int dst2;
 //lecture de deux ints (il est possible de lire de pleins de maniÃ¨res diffÃ©rentes)
 ifs >> dst >> dst2;
 
 ifs.close();

 std::cout << dst << " " << dst2 << std::endl;

 // output filestream
 std::ofstream ofs("test.out");
 // Ecriture dans le fichier
 ofs << "i like ponies" << std::endl;
 ofs.close();
}
```
# Cpp piscine Day 02

## Ad-hoc Polymorphism / Surcharge de fonctions

We define several functions sharing same name but with different parameters:

```c++

class Sample {
    public:
        Sample ( void );
        ~Sample ( void );

        void foo ( char const c) const;
        void foo ( int const n) const;
        void foo ( float const z) const;
        void foo ( Sample  const & i) const;

};
```

## Operator Overload

c++ has a syntasis to increase operators funcionality.

Notations

Infix : 1 + 1
Prefix: + 1 1 or functional notation +(1 1)
Postfix: 1 1 +

1.+( 1 ) 
Instance that call a function member (operator plus) wiht one argument.

```c++
class Integer {
    public:
        Integer ( int const n );  //constructor
        ~Integer ( void ) ;      //destructor

        int getValue ( void ) const ; //accessor;

        Integer & operator=( Integer const & rhs );  //asignation op. overload
        Integer   operator+( Integer const & rhs ) const;  //addition op. overload
        // rhs stands for right hand side.
        // lhs stands for left hadn side. it is hidden at declaration but is "this->" in the implementation.

    private:
         int _n;
};

std::ostream & operator<<( std::ostream & os, Integer const & rhs);
```
Special keyword **operator** transforms a simple declaration of a class member function into an operator overload.

There are unary, binary and ternary operators. Last ones are not overloadble.
The number or parameters has to agree the operator arity.

Remember that c++ implicitly pass to each function member an instance of the current class

Especial attention to operator pre-increment and post increment.

### asignation

As there is a change of the lhs, we do not use ``` const ```
```c++
        Integer & operator=( Integer const & rhs );  //asignation op. overload
```

we return a reference to the current class cause in c++ a multiple assignation is possible

```c++
        a = b = c = d;
```

```c++
        Integer & Integer::operator=( Integer const & rhs )  //asignation op. overload
		{
			this->_n = rhs.getValue();
			return *this;  //dereference the pointer to get the reference
		}
```

### addition

No addition operand is modified, so we use  ``` const ```


```c++
        Integer  operator+( Integer const & rhs ) const;  //asignation op. overload
```

we return a copy of the result. 1 + 2 + 3 + 4, no matter how we use parentesis, returns same value.

```c++
        Integer  Integer::operator+( Integer const & rhs ) const //asignation op. overload
		{
			
			return Integer( this->_n + rhs.getValue() ); //new instance created
		}
```

It is not the most memory usage efficient. we create a copy. With a local declararion of a pointer would not possible return the adittion. ???? to investigate.

### stream extraction and insertion operators

Since they take the user-defined type as the right argument (b in a @ b), they must be implemented **as non-members**.
```c++
std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& os, const T& obj)
{
    // write obj to stream
    return os;
}
 
std::istream& operator>>(std::istream& is, T& obj)
{
    // read obj from stream
    if (/* T could not be constructed */)
        is.setstate(std::ios::failbit);
    return is;
}
```

In our example 

```c++
std::ostream & operator<<( std::ostream & os, Integer const & rhs)
{
	os << rhs.getValue();
	return os;  // it is already a parameter **reference**
}
```
### usage

```c++
int main()
{
	Integer x( 30 );
	Integer y( 10 );
	Integer y( 0 );

	y = Integer( 12 );
	z = x + y;
	return 0;
}
```

### Overload rules

+ Must be natural. if it 
+ Overload must be related to operator semantic.
+ Do not do it. There are few cases where a operator overload is required.

## Cannonical form of a class

It is a way to construct class with a minimal interface that allows a uniform treatment/contract of/with classes. the class must have:

+ Constructor by default. Sample( void ); it can be private.
+ Constructor by copy. Sample( Sample const & src );
+ Operator assignation. Sample & operator=( Sample const & rhs );
+ A destructor. ~Sample( void ); 

If our class has this four elements, we can say the class is in a canonical form.

The destructor must be virtual. I will learn this later.

#### Constructor by copy.
```c++
Sample( Sample const & src );

Sample::Sample( Sample const & src){
	*this = src;
	return;
}
```
The argument is an instance of the class to make a copy of it. Has const cause src will not change inside.

#### Operator assignation.
```c++
Sample & operator=( Sample const & rhs );

Sample & operator=( Sample const & rhs ){
	if (this != &rhs )
		this->_foo = rhs.getFoo();
	return *this;
}


```
It is quite similar to the constructor by copy. There, we get a new instance. Here we get an instance actualization.

#### Usage
```c++
int main () 
{
	Sample instance1;
	Sample instance2( 42 );
	Sample instance3( instance1 )

	instance3 = instance2;
	return 0;
}
```

# Cpp piscine Day 03

One class inherits form another with " colon public motherClass".

Child can call mother's constructor. 
Child does not requires call mother's destructor. it is implicitly done.
Child can call public/protectd mother's member functions or mother's attributes.

```c++
class A {
public:
  A(int x) { std::cout << "A's constructor called with x = " << x <<std::endl; }
  ~A() { std::cout << "A's destructor called" << std::endl; }
  void myFunction() {std::cout << "A's myFunction() called" << std::endl;  }
  int public_data = 10; 
};

class B : public A {
public:
  B(int x) : A(x) {     std::cout << "B's constructor called" << std::endl;   }
  ~B() { std::cout << "B's destructor called" << std::endl; }
  void callAFunction() {myFunction(); public_data +=1;}// Directly call A's myFunction()
  void access_base_class_members() {
    std::cout << "public_data from A: " << public_data << std::endl; 
    public_function(); 
  }
};

```

The child class can redefine a motherclass' function member. Only requires a new function member with the same signature. This is called **method overriding or function overriding**.

```c++
class Animal {
public:
    void makeSound() {
        cout << "Generic animal sound" << endl;
    }
};

// Derived class (Child class)
class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void makeSound() { // Redefines makeSound() from the base class
        cout << "Woof!" << endl;
    }
};

```

A pointer of type Animal* is created and assigned the address of the Dog object.
When animalPtr->makeSound() is called, the makeSound() method of the Dog class is executed, demonstrating polymorphism. 
This happens because the compiler determines the actual type of the object being pointed to at runtime.
```c++
int main() {
    Animal animal;
    animal.makeSound(); // Output: Generic animal sound

    Dog dog;
    dog.makeSound(); // Output: Woof!

    // Polymorphism: Using a base class pointer to refer to a derived class object
    Animal* animalPtr = &dog; 
    animalPtr->makeSound(); // Output: Woof! (Method of the derived class is called)

    return 0;
}
```




# Cpp piscine Day 04

### The compiler trust the programmer .....

In this example, b-warrior is defined as character, so the compiler executes the Character's sayHello() function member when we invoke the sayHello() member function of the warrior.
``` c++
class Character{
	public: 
		void sayHello();
}
class Warrior : public Character {
	public:
		void sayHello();
}

void Character::sayHello () {
	std::cout << "Character Hello " << std::endl;
}

void Warrior::sayHello () {
	std::cout << "Warrior Hello " << std::endl;
}
int main()
	Warrior* 	a= new Warrior();
	Character*	b = new Warrior() //OK cause Warrior inherits from Character
	Warrior* 	c = new Character() //KO. 
	//Although they ARE related (a warrior IS-A Character), the reverse in untrue, 
	// a character not always is a warrior)

	a->sayHello();//>>Warrior Hello
	b->sayHello();//>>Character Hello
```

we require the keyword **virtual** to override such behaviour.  Virtual makes a dynamic linkages instead the static linkage from this previous case.

In this previous case , at compiling time the b type is defined as character. it can not change later, so b->sayHello() prints a Character's hello.

Virtual instruct the compiler to dig in the heritage process to find the real method that to executed.

## Clases Abstractes









## clases imbriques
It is de definition of a class inside a class
```c++
class Cat
{
  public:
    Cat(void);
    virtual ~Cat(void);

    class Leg
    {
      Leg(void);
      virtual ~Leg(void);
      //
    };
};

int main(void)
{
  Cat somecat();
  Cat::Leg someleg();

  return (0);
}
```
## Exception

One exception is a technique to send a message in the stack's call to funcitions.

Inside a **try** block, when my code detects an error, it **throws** an exception. Then, execution flow exits current scope till first **catch** block.

```c++
#include <stdexcept>

try 
{
 //do somethin here
 if (/**/){
	throw std::exception();
 } else {
	test3();
 }
}
catch (CustomerException &e)
{
 // Handle error
}
catch (std::exception &e)
{
 // Handle other error differently
}
// Allow to catch any type of exception
catch (...)
{
 //...
}
```


### custom exceptions
```c++
class CustomException: public std::exception
{
 public:
  virtual const char * what() const throw()
  {
     return "Error";
  }
};
```

### example
```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <stdexcept>

int divide(int a, int b) {
    if (b == 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Division by zero!"); 
    }
    return a / b;
}

int main() {
    try {
        int result = divide(10, 0); 
        std::cout << "Result: " << result << std::endl; 
    } catch (const std::runtime_error& e) { 
        std::cerr << "Error: " << e.what() << std::endl; 
    }
    return 0;
}
```

# Additional Material 

## Subtype Polymorfism (runtime polymorfism)
It's the ability to use derived classes through base class pointers and references.

All of Felidae biological family, and they all should be able to meow, they can be represented as classes inheriting from **Felid base class** and **overriding** the meow **pure virtual function**.

Main program can use Cat, Tiger and Ocelot interchangeably through Felid (base class) pointer.

```c++
class Felid {
public:
 virtual void meow() = 0;
};

class Cat : public Felid {
public:
 void meow() { std::cout << "Meowing like a regular cat! meow!\n"; }
};

class Tiger : public Felid {
public:
 void meow() { std::cout << "Meowing like a tiger! MREOWWW!\n"; }
};

class Ocelot : public Felid {
public:
 void meow() { std::cout << "Meowing like an ocelot! mews!\n"; }
};

void do_meowing(Felid *cat) {
 cat->meow();
}

int main() {
 Cat cat;
 Tiger tiger;
 Ocelot ocelot;

 do_meowing(&cat);
 do_meowing(&tiger);
 do_meowing(&ocelot);
}
```
Subtype polymorphism is also called runtime polymorphism for a good reason. The resolution of polymorphic function calls happens at runtime through an indirection **via the virtual table**. Another way of explaining this is that compiler does not locate the address of the function to be called at compile-time, instead when the program is run, the function is called by dereferencing the right pointer in the virtual table.

In type theory it's also known as inclusion polymorphism.

## Parametric polymorphism (compile-time polymorphins)
In C++ parametric polymorphism is implemented via templates. It happens at compile time.

Parametric polymorphism provides a means to execute the same code for any type. One of the simplest examples is a generic max function that finds maximum of two of its arguments.


```c++
template <class T>
T max(T a, T b) {
 return a > b ? a : b;
}

int main() {
 std::cout << ::max(9, 5) << std::endl;     // 9

 std::string foo("foo"), bar("bar");
 std::cout << ::max(foo, bar) << std::endl; // "foo"
}
```

## Ad-hoc polymorphism (oveloading)

Ad-hoc polymorphism allows functions with the same name act differently for each type. For example, given two ints and the + operator, it adds them together. Given two std::strings it concatenates them together. This is called overloading.

Here is a concrete example that implements function add for ints and strings,

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int add(int a, int b) {
 return a + b;
}

std::string add(const char *a, const char *b) {
 std::string result(a);
 result += b;
 return result;
}

int main() {
 std::cout << add(5, 9) << std::endl;
 std::cout << add("hello ", "world") << std::endl;
}
```


## Coercion polymorphism (Casting)

Coercion happens when an object or a primitive is cast into another object type or primitive type. 
It differs from type promotion (int to double) or type demotion (double to int).

There is implicit coercion.

```c++
float b = 6; // int gets promoted (cast) to float implicitly
int a = 9.99 // float gets demoted to int implicitly
```
There is c explicit coercion. Good practice avoids this in c++.

```c
a =(int)b;
```

There is c++ explicit coercion.
```c++
static_cast, const_cast, reinterpret_cast, or dynamic_cast.
```
### static_cast<int>
Double d =42 ;
int i = static_cast<int>(d) ; // Explicit demotion

#### static_cast with classes belonging to same inheritance tree. 
```c++
class Parent {};
class Child_1: public Parent {} ;
class Child_2: public Parent {} ;

class Unrelated {};

Child_1 = a;
Parent * p = &a;                                   // Implicit upcast from child to parent
Child_1 * c1 = p;                                  // Implicit dowcast from Parent to Child_1 : KO
Child_2 * c2 = static_cast<Child_2 *>(p) ;         // Explicit downcast from Parent to Child_2: OK
Unrelated * u = static_cast<Unrelated *>(&a) :     // Explicit downcast from Parent to Child_2: KO Unrelated clases
```
### dynamic_cast
It is the unique cast taking place at runtime. 
Requires error protection.
Only works with polymorphism having an virtual member in the class with a virtual method.

```c++
class Parent {public: virtual ~Parent( void ) {} };
class Child_1: public Parent {} ;
class Child_2: public Parent {} ;

//the virtual method creates a vtable RTTI (Runtime Type info) . It is information about types saved internally in the class. It allows the dynamic cast to verify it is feasible.


Child_1 = a;
Parent * p = &a;                                   // Implicit upcast from child to parent

// Explicit Downcast by pointer
Child_1 * c1 = dynamic_cast,Child_1 *>(p);
if ( c == NULL ) {
	std::cout << "Conversion is NOT OK" << std::endl ;
} else {
	std::cout << "Conversion is OK << std::endl ;
}

// Explicit Downcast by reference
try {
} catch (std::bad_cast &bc) {
	std::cout << "Conversion is NOT OK << bc.what() << std::endl;
	return 0 ;
}  
```

      // Implicit dowcast from Parent to Child_1 : KO
Child_2 * c2 = static_cast<Child_2 *>(p) ;         // Explicit downcast from Parent to Child_2: OK
Unrelated * u = static_cast<Unrelated *>(&a) :     // Explicit downcast from Parent to Child_2: KO Unrelated clases
