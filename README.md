# CPP_00
Namespaces, classes, member functions, stdio streams, initialization lists, static, const, and some other basic stuff.


The goal of these modules is to introduce you to Object-Oriented Programming.

This will be the starting point of your C++ journey. Many languages are recommended to learn OOP. We chose C++ since itâ€™s derived from your old friend C.

Because this is a complex language, and to keep things simple, your code will comply with the C++98 standard.

You will discover new concepts step-by-step. The exercises will progressively increase in complexity.

## C++ 98 Standard

Below are the key features and improvements brought by C++ 98:


|Feature|	Description|	Syntax|
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
|**Templates**|	C++ 98 standardized the use of templates, allowing the <ins>creation of generic functions and classes</ins>. This made it possible to write code that works with any data type.|	```template <typename T> T add(T a, T b) { return a + b; }```|
|**Exceptions**	|Exception handling was standardized in C++ 98, providing a <ins>structured way to handle errors</ins> and exceptional conditions in programs.	|```try { // code } catch (exception& e) { // handle error }```|
|**Namespaces**|	C++ 98 introduced namespaces to <ins>avoid name conflicts by grouping entities</ins> like classes, objects, and functions under a specific name.|	```namespace MyNamespace { int value; }```|
|The **bool Type**|	C++ 98 introduced the bool data type, along with the <ins>true and false</ins> keywords, for representing boolean values.|	```bool flag = true;```|
|The **typename** Keyword|	The typename keyword was introduced to <ins>disambiguate dependent names</ins> in templates, improving readability and reducing errors.|```typename T::iterator it;```|
|The **explicit** Keyword|	C++ 98 introduced the explicit keyword to <ins>prevent implicit type conversions</ins>, which can lead to subtle bugs.	|```explicit MyClass(int value);```|
|Member Function **const**ness|	C++ 98 allowed member functions to be declared as const, <ins>ensuring that they do not modify the object on which they are called</ins>.|```	int getValue() const { return value; }```|
|**Member Templates**|C++ 98 introduced the ability to <ins>define templates within class definitions</ins>, allowing for more flexible and reusable code.|```template <typename T> class MyClass { /*...*/ };```|
|**Template Specialization**|Allows the creation of template specializations for specific types, enabling <ins>more efficient or specialized implementations</ins>.|```template<> class MyClass<int> { /*...*/ };```|
|**Multiple Inheritance and Virtual Functions**|C++ 98 standardized the behavior of multiple inheritance and virtual functions, ensuring <ins>consistency across compilers</ins>.|```class Derived : public Base1, public Base2 { };```|
|The **mutable** Keyword|Allows modification of class members even if the containing object is const, providing <ins>more flexibility in certain designs</ins>.|```mutable int counter;```|
|**Dynamic Memory Management**|C++ 98 standardized the new and delete operators to <ins>handle heap memory allocation and deallocation consistently</ins>.|```c int* p = new int(5); delete p; ```|
